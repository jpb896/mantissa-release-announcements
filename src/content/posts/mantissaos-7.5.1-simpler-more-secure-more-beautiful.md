MantissaOS 7.5.1 is now available!
It is a pretty sizable update, coming with UI redesigns for the notification shade and calendar app.

## New features
### Notification shade blur
Notification shade blur is the highlight of this update, bringing increased visibility of the currently open app behind the notification shade.

In battery saver, this blur simply becomes a light grey semi-transparent layer over the app below it.
### New notification row design
The notification column received a design overhaul, with the 'Clear all' button being significantly more prominent and easier to reach with one hand.

Additionally, notification settings is now accessible through the gear icon on the right, while notification history can now be reached from the notification shade, with the button to reach it being on the left.
### Material 3 Calendar redesign
The Calendar app has now received a preliminary (unfinished) Material Design 3 redesign to fit in better with the rest of the operating system.

It will be perfected in subsequent updates.
## Device support/rollout
MantissaOS 7.5.1 is now available for the following devices:

- Android Emulator x86_64 (emu64x; released 18/7/2025)
