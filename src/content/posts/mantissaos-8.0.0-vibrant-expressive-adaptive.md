MantissaOS 8.0.0 is now available!
It is the biggest update of the year, coming with the latest Android version and a systemwide UI overhaul.

## New features
### Based on Android 16
MantissaOS 8.x is based on Android 16, bringing support for new APIs and features, such as Seamless App Updates and Live Updates.
### Material 3 Expressive
The OS now uses the new Material 3 Expressive design language, which is more fluid, modern and dynamic.
### New Quick Settings
The Quick Settings panel has received the biggest overhaul to date, allowing for increased customizability, as well as a new tile design.

In terms of customizability, users can now resize tiles between 1x1 and 2x1 sizes, allowing certain more important options to be easily emphasized.
### Material 3 Calendar redesign
The Calendar app now has a finished Material 3 redesign.
## Device support/rollout
MantissaOS 8.0.0 is now available for the following devices:

- Android Emulator x86_64 (emu64x; released 30/8/2025)
- Pixel 6a (bluejay; released 31/8/2025)

It can be downloaded from SourceForge and flashed manually through recovery only, as using the Updater app won't work.
